1. **["mk001-mad_libs.py"](https://github.com/karakose77/udacity-cs101-intro-to-computer-science-exercises-and-projects/blob/master/mk001-mad_libs.py)**: A simple mad lib game in which one player prompts others for a list of words to substitute for blanks in a story, before reading the – often comical or nonsensical – story aloud.
2. **["mk002-turtled.py"](https://github.com/karakose77/udacity-cs101-intro-to-computer-science-exercises-and-projects/blob/master/mk002-turtled.py)**: Defines the turtle movement for the initialized turtle instance and executes that movement.
3. **["mk003-days_between_dates.py"](https://github.com/karakose77/udacity-cs101-intro-to-computer-science-exercises-and-projects/blob/master/mk003-days_between_dates.py)**: Returns total amount of days between two dates, leap days included.
4. **["mk004-check_sudoku.py"](https://github.com/karakose77/udacity-cs101-intro-to-computer-science-exercises-and-projects/blob/master/mk004-check_sudoku.py)**: Returns true if given sudoku matrix is valid.
5. **["mk005-is_symmetric.py"](https://github.com/karakose77/udacity-cs101-intro-to-computer-science-exercises-and-projects/blob/master/mk005-is_symmetric.py)**: Returns True if given list is symmetric.
6. **["mk006-is_identity_matrix.py"](https://github.com/karakose77/udacity-cs101-intro-to-computer-science-exercises-and-projects/blob/master/mk006-is_identity_matrix.py)**: Returns True if the input matrix is an identity matrix, False otherwise.
7. **["mk007-is_anti_symmetric.py"](https://github.com/karakose77/udacity-cs101-intro-to-computer-science-exercises-and-projects/blob/master/mk007-is_anti_symmetric.py)**: Returns True if the input matrix is anti-symmetric, False otherwise.
8. **["mk008-frequency_analyzer.py"](https://github.com/karakose77/udacity-cs101-intro-to-computer-science-exercises-and-projects/blob/master/mk008-frequency_analyzer.py)**: Return the frequencies of all characters in input string, by counting all repetitions of a character and dividing it by the count of all characters.
9. **["mk009-is_palindrome_recursive.py"](https://github.com/karakose77/udacity-cs101-intro-to-computer-science-exercises-and-projects/blob/master/mk009-is_palindrome_recursive.py)**: Returns true if input string is a palindrome.
10. **["mk010-deep_count.py"](https://github.com/karakose77/udacity-cs101-intro-to-computer-science-exercises-and-projects/blob/master/mk010-deep_count.py)**: Count the number of deepest single elements in a list. If an element is also a list add the count of that list to the previous count.
11. **["mk011-pick_one.py"](https://github.com/karakose77/udacity-cs101-intro-to-computer-science-exercises-and-projects/blob/master/mk011-pick_one.py)**: Takes three inputs: a Boolean and two other values. If the first input is True, it returns the second input. If the first input is False, it returns the third input.
12. **["mk012-date_converter.py"](https://github.com/karakose77/udacity-cs101-intro-to-computer-science-exercises-and-projects/blob/master/mk012-date_converter.py)**: Takes two inputs: a dictionary of months and month numbers and a date in 'mm/dd/yyyy' format. Return the date in 'day month year' format.
13. **["mk013-longest_repetition.py"](https://github.com/karakose77/udacity-cs101-intro-to-computer-science-exercises-and-projects/blob/master/mk013-longest_repetition.py)**: Takes as input a list, and returns the element in the list that has the most consecutive repetitions. If there are multiple elements that have the same number of longest repetitions, returns the one that appears first. If the input list is empty, returns None.
14. **["mk014-deep_reverse.py"](https://github.com/karakose77/udacity-cs101-intro-to-computer-science-exercises-and-projects/blob/master/mk014-deep_reverse.py)**: Takes as input a list, and returns a new list that is the deep reverse of the input list. This means it reverses all the elements in the list, and if any of those elements are lists themselves, reverses all the elements in the inner list, all the way down.
15. **["mk015-stirling_and_bell.py"](https://github.com/karakose77/udacity-cs101-intro-to-computer-science-exercises-and-projects/blob/master/mk015-stirling_and_bell.py)**: Stirling method takes as its inputs two positive integers of which the first is the number of items and the second is the number of sets into which those items will be split. Returns total number of k_sets created from n_items.  
Bell method returns the total number of k_sets of stirling numbers for k_sets = 1, 2, ... , n.
