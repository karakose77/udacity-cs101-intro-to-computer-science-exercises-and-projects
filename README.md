If there are multiple elements that have the same number of longest repetitions, returns the one that appears first. If the input list is empty, returns None.
14. **["mk014-deep_reverse.py"](https://github.com/karakose77/udacity-cs101-intro-to-computer-science-exercises-and-projects/blob/master/mk014-deep_reverse.py)**: Takes as input a list, and returns a new list that is the deep reverse of the input list. This means it reverses all the elements in the list, and if any of those elements are lists themselves, reverses all the elements in the inner list, all the way down.
15. **["mk015-stirling_and_bell.py"](https://github.com/karakose77/udacity-cs101-intro-to-computer-science-exercises-and-projects/blob/master/mk015-stirling_and_bell.py)**: Stirling method takes as its inputs two positive integers of which the first is the number of items and the second is the number of sets into which those items will be split. Returns total number of k_sets created from n_items.  
Bell method returns the total number of k_sets of stirling numbers for k_sets = 1, 2, ... , n.
16. **["mk016-cellular_automaton.py"](https://github.com/karakose77/udacity-cs101-intro-to-computer-science-exercises-and-projects/blob/master/mk016-cellular_automaton.py)**:Takes three inputs:  
    a non-empty string,  
    a pattern number which is an integer between 0 and 255 that represents a set of rules,  
    and a positive integer, n, which is the number of generations.  
    Returns a string which is the result of applying the rules
    generated by the pattern to the string n times.
17. **["mk017-pascal_triangle.py"](https://github.com/karakose77/udacity-cs101-intro-to-computer-science-exercises-and-projects/blob/master/mk017-pascal_triangle.py)**: Returns a Pascal Triangle of n rows.

    They are calculated as follows:  
    1 = 1  
    1 + 2 = 3  
    1 + 2 + 3 = 6  
    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10  
    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15  
    Returns nth triangular number.
19. **["mk019-project_gamers_network.py"](https://github.com/karakose77/udacity-cs101-intro-to-computer-science-exercises-and-projects/blob/master/mk019-project_gamers_network.py)**: In a website, the data is stored in a database. In our case, however, all the information comes in a big string of text. This project creates a data structure that manages the game-network information and to define several procedures that operate on the network.
20. **["mk020-project_web_crawler.py"](https://github.com/karakose77/udacity-cs101-intro-to-computer-science-exercises-and-projects/blob/master/mk020-project_web_crawler.py)**: A web crawler is a program that collects content from the web. It finds web pages by starting from a seed page and following links to find other pages, and following links from the other pages it finds, and continuing to follow links until it has found many web pages. Some of the functions defined in the project are below. Details are inside.
    * "get_page(url)"
    * "get_next_target(page)"
    * "get_all_links(page)"
    * "union(a, b)"
    * "add_page_to_index(index, url, content)"
    * "add_to_index(index, keyword, url)"
    * "crawl_web(seed)"
    * "compute_ranks(graph)"
    * "look_up(index, keyword)"
    * "lucky_search(index, ranks, keyword)"
    * "record_user_click(index, keyword, url)"
    * "remove_tags(s)"
  
21. **["mk021-project_hash_function.py"](https://github.com/karakose77/udacity-cs101-intro-to-computer-science-exercises-and-projects/blob/master/mk021-project_hash_function.py)**: Given a keyword, the hash function will tell where to look in the index. It will map the keyword to a number(takes in a keyword and outputs a number) which is the position in the index where you should look for the keyword. This means we don't have to start at the beginning and look all the way through the index to find the keyword we are looking for making the search process faster. Some of the functions defined in the project are below. Details are inside.
    * "hash_table_update(hash_table, keyword, value)"
    * "hash_table_lookup(hash_table, keyword)"
    * "hash_table_add(hash_table, keyword, value)"
    * "hash_table_get_bucket(hash_table, keyword)"
    * "make_hash_table(nbuckets)"
    * "hash_string(keyword, buckets)"
    * "test_hash(hash_function, url, size)"
    * "source_get(url)"
    * "source_clean(source)"
